            The Journey, Uncut (Short Version)

        I once chased a white coat. I studied to become a doctor, but when I couldn’t achieve the required CCS score in A/Ls, that dream ended. I was lost — but not done. <br />
        I threw myself into everything I could: crypto, stock trading, dropshipping, affiliate marketing, even a spice export idea. None took off, but each one taught me something about risk, markets, and resilience.<br />
        My first real step forward was Digital Escapes, helping hotels and villas grow online. It proved I could build something real. Then came Xtream Digital, built to scale beyond hospitality — a next-level marketing and content powerhouse for startups and brands.<br />
        But along this journey, I realized something — the world only shows success after it happens. No one shows the messy middle.  So I created Startup Uncut — to build in public, fail in public, learn in public, and rise in public.
